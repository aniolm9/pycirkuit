# Contributing to PyCirkuit

You are here to help on PyCirkuit? Awesome! PyCirkuit is still at its infancy and needs a lot of love and work. If tou find this application useful, there are some areas where you can help, depending on your interests and level of expertise:

  - Writing documentation
  - Translating the app to your native language
  - Finding bugs and fixing issues
  - Contributing code


## Contributing guidelines

At present, PyCirkuit is a small project with little infrastructure around. For now it's hosted at my university's git infrastructure ([https://gitlab.upc.edu](https://gitlab.upc.edu)) but, as this gitlab is relatively closed to non-university members, I'm planning to host it somewhere else in the future.

Meanwhile, you can ask questions or send contributions directly to me at [mailto:orestes@tsc.upc.edu](mailto:orestes@tsc.upc.edu).

**Thanks!**
